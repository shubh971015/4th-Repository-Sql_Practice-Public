I analyzed loan applications and trends by tracking their count monthly and yearly, with a particular focus on December compared to other months. I calculated the total loan amount disbursed overall and by month, observing how this changed over time. I also determined the total amount received from borrowers each month to understand the bank's cash flow better.

I computed the average interest rate and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, including their monthly variations, to gain insights into loan costs and borrower financial health. To assess loan quality, I categorized loans into 'Good' (fully paid or current) and 'Bad' (charged off) and calculated the percentages, counts, and amounts for each category.

I created a summary showing the status of loans, including total amounts given and received for each status. I conducted a detailed breakdown of loans based on various dimensions such as purpose, state, loan term, employee length, and home ownership status.

Finally, I focused on 'A' grade loans to understand their purposes and associated financial details.
